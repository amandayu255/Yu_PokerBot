# Poker Bot

This project is an AI bot that plays heads-up Texas Hold’em (2 players: your bot vs. one opponent) using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to decide whether to fold or stay in a hand.

It uses MCTS to simulate possible opponent hands and future community cards to estimate this probability. This project teaches decision-making under uncertainty—a core AI concept—by applying MCTS to handle hidden information (the opponent’s cards).

## Usage

```bash
python3 PokerBot.py
